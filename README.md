![](demo.gif)

This project can be started by EITHER:

1. Going to the starter project in trinket and remixing it: https://trinket.io/python/2a47e8809a (the starter project contains the images you will need) OR

2. Creating a new project in trinket, copying and pasting the contents of [start_code.py](./resources/start_code.py) into the new project file, and adding the images from the [resources](./resources) directory to the trinket (top-right button of the text editing area).

Go through the details of each step in these instructions to build up the components of the game.
